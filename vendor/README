Vendor folder
=============
The files in this folder should get automatically created by Composer.
When running the application, first make sure that Composer has parsed the
composer.json file in the root.

Files that do not use Composer are NOT autoloaded by default. If you want to use
vendor files that are not installed by Composer, make sure you create an
autoloader for these files, or load them automatically using the Folders class.
